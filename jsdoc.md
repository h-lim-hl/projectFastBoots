Your JSDoc configuration file is almost correct and will work well for generating documentation, but there are a couple of minor adjustments you might consider for optimal configuration. Here’s a breakdown of your configuration and any recommended changes:

### Your Configuration File

```json
{
  "source": {
    "include": ["./js"], // Path to your source files
    "includePattern": ".+\\.js(doc|on)?$"
  },
  "opts": {
    "destination": "./docs", // Output directory for the generated documentation
    "recurse": true // Recurse into subdirectories
  },
  "plugins": ["plugins/markdown"]
}
```

### Explanation of Each Section

1. **source.include**: This specifies the directory where your JavaScript files are located. In your case, it points to the `./js` directory. This is correct, assuming that your JavaScript source files are indeed in that folder.

2. **source.includePattern**: This regex pattern matches files you want to include. Your current pattern `".+\\.js(doc|on)?$"` effectively matches any `.js`, `.jsdoc`, or `.json` files. This is fine, but if you only want to include standard JavaScript files, you can simplify it to `".+\\.js$"`.

3. **opts.destination**: This is the output directory where JSDoc will generate the documentation. Your setting of `"./docs"` is correct and indicates that the documentation will be placed in a folder named `docs` at the root of your project.

4. **opts.recurse**: Setting `true` allows JSDoc to include files in subdirectories of the specified source directory. This is useful if you have a nested folder structure for your JavaScript files.

5. **plugins**: You are including the `markdown` plugin, which allows you to use Markdown syntax in your JSDoc comments. This is great if you want to format your documentation comments with Markdown.

### Recommended Adjustments

Here’s a revised version of your configuration file with the suggested adjustments:

```json
{
  "source": {
    "include": ["./js"], // Path to your source files
    "includePattern": ".+\\.js$" // Matches only .js files
  },
  "opts": {
    "destination": "./docs", // Output directory for the generated documentation
    "recurse": true // Recurse into subdirectories
  },
  "plugins": ["plugins/markdown"]
}
```

### Final Thoughts

- **Ensure Correct Directory Structure**: Make sure that the `./js` directory exists and contains your JavaScript files before running JSDoc.
- **Run JSDoc**: After saving your configuration file, run JSDoc using:

  ```bash
  npx jsdoc -c jsdoc.json
  ```

- **Check Output**: After running JSDoc, check the `docs` folder for the generated documentation and ensure everything is as expected.

### Conclusion

Your configuration will work with the original settings, but the small adjustment to `includePattern` can help you avoid unnecessary file matches. Otherwise, you are good to go with this configuration for generating documentation for your JavaScript files!

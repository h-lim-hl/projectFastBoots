If your website does not use Node.js and is simply a static site that uses JavaScript in the browser, the process for using JSDoc is quite similar. However, you won't need to worry about Node.js-specific setups or configurations. Here’s how to use JSDoc in a purely client-side JavaScript environment:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Using JSDoc for a Static Website

#### Step 1: Install JSDoc

Even for a static website, it is beneficial to have JSDoc available. You can still install JSDoc via npm, which will require Node.js, but you don't need to run a Node server. Alternatively, you can use JSDoc as a standalone tool without installing it through npm.

1. **Using npm (Recommended if you have Node.js installed):**

   Navigate to your project directory and run:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jsdoc
   ```

2. **Using JSDoc Standalone (without npm):**

   - Download the latest release of JSDoc from the [JSDoc GitHub releases page](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc/releases).
   - Unzip the downloaded file and locate the `jsdoc` executable in the `jsdoc` folder.

#### Step 2: Write JSDoc Comments

In your JavaScript files, add JSDoc comments to document your functions, classes, or variables. Here's an example:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the area of a rectangle.
 * @param {number} width - The width of the rectangle.
 * @param {number} height - The height of the rectangle.
 * @returns {number} The area of the rectangle.
 */
function calculateArea(width, height) {
    return width * height;
}
```

#### Step 3: Create a Configuration File (Optional)

If you want to customize your documentation generation, you can create a JSDoc configuration file named `jsdoc.json`. This step is optional but helpful for organizing your documentation output.

```json
{
  "source": {
    "include": ["./src"], // Path to your source files
    "includePattern": ".+\\.js(doc|on)?$",
    "excludePattern": "(node_modules/|docs/)"
  },
  "opts": {
    "destination": "./docs", // Output directory for the generated documentation
    "recurse": true // Recurse into subdirectories
  },
  "plugins": ["plugins/markdown"]
}
```

#### Step 4: Generate Documentation

You can generate the documentation either by running the JSDoc command in the terminal or using the standalone executable.

1. **Using npm:**

   If you installed JSDoc via npm, you can generate the documentation with:

   ```bash
   npx jsdoc -c jsdoc.json
   ```

   Or without a configuration file, you could run:

   ```bash
   npx jsdoc ./src
   ```

2. **Using Standalone JSDoc:**

   Navigate to the directory where you unzipped JSDoc, and run:

   ```bash
   node jsdoc yourfile.js
   ```

   Or if you have a configuration file:

   ```bash
   node jsdoc -c jsdoc.json
   ```

   Replace `yourfile.js` with the path to your JavaScript file(s).

#### Step 5: View the Documentation

After running the command, JSDoc will generate HTML documentation in the specified output directory (e.g., `./docs`). Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the generated documentation.

### Example Project Structure

Here’s how your static website project structure might look:

```
my-static-website/
│
├── src/
│   ├── script.js           // Your JavaScript file with JSDoc comments
│   └── another-script.js    // Another JS file (if needed)
│
├── docs/                   // Generated documentation will be placed here
│
├── jsdoc.json              // Optional JSDoc configuration file
│
├── index.html              // Your main HTML file
│
└── styles.css              // Your CSS file
```

### Summary

1. **Install JSDoc** using npm or download it standalone.
2. **Add JSDoc comments** in your JavaScript files.
3. (Optional) **Create a JSDoc configuration file** for custom documentation options.
4. **Run JSDoc** to generate the documentation.
5. **Open the generated documentation** in a web browser.

### Additional Tips

- **Documentation Format:** Ensure your comments are clear and well-structured; this will help users of your code understand its functionality quickly.
- **Include Examples:** You can include usage examples in your JSDoc comments to illustrate how to use your functions or classes effectively.
- **Automating Documentation Generation:** If you regularly update your documentation, consider creating a simple script to automate the process. You could use a `Makefile` or batch script to streamline the generation.

By following these steps, you can effectively use JSDoc to document your client-side JavaScript code, enhancing its readability and maintainability for yourself and other developers!

Your JSDoc configuration file is almost correct and will work well for generating documentation, but there are a couple of minor adjustments you might consider for optimal configuration. Here’s a breakdown of your configuration and any recommended changes:

### Your Configuration File

```json
{
  "source": {
    "include": ["./js"], // Path to your source files
    "includePattern": ".+\\.js(doc|on)?$"
  },
  "opts": {
    "destination": "./docs", // Output directory for the generated documentation
    "recurse": true // Recurse into subdirectories
  },
  "plugins": ["plugins/markdown"]
}
```

### Explanation of Each Section

1. **source.include**: This specifies the directory where your JavaScript files are located. In your case, it points to the `./js` directory. This is correct, assuming that your JavaScript source files are indeed in that folder.

2. **source.includePattern**: This regex pattern matches files you want to include. Your current pattern `".+\\.js(doc|on)?$"` effectively matches any `.js`, `.jsdoc`, or `.json` files. This is fine, but if you only want to include standard JavaScript files, you can simplify it to `".+\\.js$"`.

3. **opts.destination**: This is the output directory where JSDoc will generate the documentation. Your setting of `"./docs"` is correct and indicates that the documentation will be placed in a folder named `docs` at the root of your project.

4. **opts.recurse**: Setting `true` allows JSDoc to include files in subdirectories of the specified source directory. This is useful if you have a nested folder structure for your JavaScript files.

5. **plugins**: You are including the `markdown` plugin, which allows you to use Markdown syntax in your JSDoc comments. This is great if you want to format your documentation comments with Markdown.

### Recommended Adjustments

Here’s a revised version of your configuration file with the suggested adjustments:

```json
{
  "source": {
    "include": ["./js"], // Path to your source files
    "includePattern": ".+\\.js$" // Matches only .js files
  },
  "opts": {
    "destination": "./docs", // Output directory for the generated documentation
    "recurse": true // Recurse into subdirectories
  },
  "plugins": ["plugins/markdown"]
}
```

### Final Thoughts

- **Ensure Correct Directory Structure**: Make sure that the `./js` directory exists and contains your JavaScript files before running JSDoc.
- **Run JSDoc**: After saving your configuration file, run JSDoc using:

  ```bash
  npx jsdoc -c jsdoc.json
  ```

- **Check Output**: After running JSDoc, check the `docs` folder for the generated documentation and ensure everything is as expected.

### Conclusion

Your configuration will work with the original settings, but the small adjustment to `includePattern` can help you avoid unnecessary file matches. Otherwise, you are good to go with this configuration for generating documentation for your JavaScript files!
